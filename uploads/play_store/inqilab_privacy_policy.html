  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>
    DEZDOK PRIVATE LIMITED built the Inqilab app as a free service for authorized users created and managed via an admin panel.
    This app is intended for internal use only, and we take user privacy seriously.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Information Collection</h2>

    Inqilab does <strong>not</strong> collect or store any personal information directly from users via the app.
    All user data is preconfigured and managed via the admin panel by the organization.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Camera Permission</h2>
  <p>
    Inqilab requests permission to access the device's <strong>camera</strong> for the following purposes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Uploading images as <strong>payment proof</strong> while requesting a payment.</li>
    <li>Updating the user's <strong>profile picture</strong>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These images are directly uploaded to the backend server and are not stored or processed locally or by the app outside of this intended use.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Data Storage</h2>
  <p>
    Inqilab does <strong>not</strong> store any data locally on the device.
    All data, including user details and uploaded images, is managed and stored securely on the server,
    which is controlled via the admin panel.
